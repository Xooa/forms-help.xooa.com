the platform and converted into dynamic, API based, forms that interface directly with the user applications. 

Here is a list of some components that can be interface with PDFs: 

  - **Text** 
  - **Numbers** 
  - **Passwords** 
  - **Drowdowns** 
  - **eSignatures** 
  - **Email Addresses** 
  - **Phone Numbers** 
  - **Date & Time**
  - **Currencies** 

The number API requests and PDFs a project can have corresponds to the plan associated with the particular project.
