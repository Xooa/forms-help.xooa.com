Forms are the primary interface within the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** system. Design a Form by dragging and dropping Form components onto the Form component area. Form components that are placed onto a Form will determine what that Form object looks like. You do not need to create an API before creating the Form. A compatible API will automatically be mapped out for you as you design your Form.
