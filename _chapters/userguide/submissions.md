Submissions are the values that were submitted to the form you built. These can be thought of as "objects" within the system and operate very much like them. You can get to an administrative view of submissions by clicking the **Data** tab on the navigation bar. Here you can see a graph which displays submission requests by year, month, or day.

You can access submissions  by clicking the data button next to the desired Form or Resource, or utilize the Export button to export CSV or JSON files for the submissions. You can also embed submissions directly using a `<formio>` Angular directive or you can query the API directly. See [Application Embedding](/developer/info/angular/) and [Developer API](/developer/api/postman/) for more information.
