Resources are used to define an object within **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;**. This is done by adding Form components to a Resource. Follow the same instructions for Forms when creating Resources. The Form components that are placed onto a Resource determine what the Resource object looks like.

The primary difference between Resources and Forms is that Resources can be embedded in other Resources and Forms while Forms cannot be.

Use Resources when you are creating a primary object that will be interacting within your system, such as a User, a Movie, or a Todo Item.
