Actions are ways of extending **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** to do actions when a form is submitted. For example, you can authenticate a user account against your User Resource, send an email or fire off a webhook to send the data to an external system.
