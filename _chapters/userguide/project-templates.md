Project templates are a very convenient way to replicate projects. Templates are JSON files that define what Roles, Resources, Forms, and Actions to create. The easiest way to generate a template is to create a project, create all the Roles, Resources, Forms, and Actions you want the template to have, and [export](#settings-project) that project. Creating new projects with this template will clone the original project it was exported from.
