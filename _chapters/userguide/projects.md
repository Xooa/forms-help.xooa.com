**Projects** are the main working areas within the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** platform used by developers to build the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** major components that will ultimately be implemented within their own customer **Applications**.   The **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** system enables developers to easily build a service for their iOS, Android, Windows apps, and websites that all interact with the same **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** major components.

Each Project is typically associated with a single corresponding customer Application.

When a developer begins work within the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** platform, they typically begin by creating a Project. Each Project will contain all of the major components for the customer Application such as **Forms**, **Resources**, **Roles**, etc.
