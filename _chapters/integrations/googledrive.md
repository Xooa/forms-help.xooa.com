Google Drive allows for external applications to create and update files within the Google platform. Currently **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** provides form actions to create and update fields within Google Sheets. In order to use the Google Sheet integration, you will need to get an OAuth token for Google Drive and get a spreadsheet ID of the Google Sheet.
