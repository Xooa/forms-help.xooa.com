Hubspot allows for external applications to create and update contacts within the Hubspot platform. Currently **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** provides form actions to create and update fields within hubspot in various manners. In order to use the Hubspot integration, you will need a Hubspot API key which is only supported on their Professional and Enterprise level plans.

Common integrations between **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** and Hubspot are:

 - Creating a contact when a user registers in an application.
 - Setting the contact's source when a user registers.
 - Updating a timestamp when an action is taken within an application.
 - Incrementing a counter in a counter field when a user performs an action.

 All of these and more integrations can be used to add the Hubspot Contact to a marketing list and perform additional followup actions within Hubspot.
