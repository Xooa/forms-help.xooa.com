Any user management application needs a way for the users to reset their password. While Form.io does provide an Action dedicated to Reset Password, manytimes you may need more granular control over the process of resetting a users password. This guide will outline how this can be accomplished.

To accomplish this task, we will be using the [Human Resources Application](https://gihtub.com/formio/formio-app-humanresources) application as a reference application. If you wish to clone that project and application to follow along how to create this workflow, then type the following within your terminal to bootstrap the application.

```
npm install -g formio-cli
formio bootstrap formio/formio-app-humanresources
```

Once you do this, you can then see in the application all of the elements this tutorial walks you through.
