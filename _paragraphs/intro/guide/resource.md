An Event Registration application will need to store some "structured" objects called **Events**. These are called **Resources** in Form.io, so lets create a new **Event** by clicking on the following.

![](/assets/img/userguide/newresource.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

We will then build our **Event** object using a form builder (pretty cool). We could also provide some field validations and such, but for now we will keep the form simple.

![](/assets/img/userguide/eventcreate.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

When you are done, click on **Create Resource**

### Assigning Permissions
You now need to allow **Authenticated** users to read all events. We will also want them to be able to **create their own**, **update their own**, and **delete their own** events. To do this, click on **Access** section, and configure the settings as follows.

![](/assets/img/userguide/eventaccess.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

The settings should automatically save when you add this role to these permissions.
