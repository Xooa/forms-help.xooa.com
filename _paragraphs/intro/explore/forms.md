Forms provide a mechanism for user input within your application. Form.io provides a form builder interface which allows you to drag and drop form components as well as reuse Resource fields to create robust, manageable, and reusable form interfaces for your web application.

For more information on creating and using forms, go to the [Forms Section](/userguide/forms/) of the User's Guide.
