In order to get started, let's first create a form within our project by clicking on the **Forms** section and then click on **Create Form**. You will be presented with the following screen.

![](/assets/img/intro/createform.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

There are two kinds of forms that are supported with Form.io

 - **API Web Form**: This is the typical webform that you would embed within an application that is also mobile responsive.
 - **PDF Forms**: This allows you to convert a PDF document into an API driven PDF form, as well as provide a way to download form submissions as PDF documents.
 
For this demonstration we will click on **API Web Form** which we will be presented with the following interface.

![](/assets/img/intro/formbuilder.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

At this point, we urge you to play around and create any form that you would like to create. Once you create the form you would like, you can then click on the **Save Form** button to save the form and create it within your Forms section.

We are now ready to embed our form!
