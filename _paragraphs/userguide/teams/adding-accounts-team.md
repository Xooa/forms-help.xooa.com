Currently teams are limited to registered users of the site; however, you can add additional team members at any time.

Using the ```add a person``` field anchored to the top right, you can 
begin adding team members using their Form.io usernames.

Much like the team owner, team admins have administrative privileges over team management meaning that team admins can both add and remove team members from a team as well as add a team to a project. It is important to note that this does not mean team admin members have additional privileges at the project level.
