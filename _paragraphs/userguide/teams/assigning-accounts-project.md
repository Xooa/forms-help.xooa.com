Please note that in order to add a team to a any project, that project must be a **Team Pro** or **Enterprise** level project. 

Once a team has been added, you will be allowed to set the permissions of the team at a project level. There are three options for permissions 

- Read - This will only allow the team to read form definitions

- Write - This will allow the team to read and write form definitions.

- Admin - This will give the team all permissions including reading and writing forms and access to all data.

You can assign multiple teams to a single project. All members of a team have the same permissions that were assigned to that team.
