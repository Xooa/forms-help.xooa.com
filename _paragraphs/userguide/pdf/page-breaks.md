Now that you are able to print a submission as a PDF, you may also wish to introduce page breaks into the PDF download. To accomplish this, first edit your form, and then click on the element you wish to push down to a different page. In our example, lets edit the **Team Information** panel. In the seetings for this panel, we will then introduce a special class to that element called **page-break-before**. This tells the PDF renderer where to introduce new page breaks.

![](/assets/img/userguide/pdf/page-break.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Now make sure to save your form.

Now, you can click on the download PDF button for any of the submissions, and it will introduce a page break before the element you provided.
