With a PDF form constructed, users can now begin to interact with submitting and viewing form data. 
Click the ```Use``` (or launch) tab to begin.  

![](/assets/img/userguide/PDF-Viewing-1.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }
 
Complete the form and click ```Submit``` at the bottom to post the submission to the projects database.
Selecting the ```Data``` tab, users can view all submissions in a data grid and can interact with individual submission.

Notice that the data displayed in the table above is overlaid on a the PDF. 

![](/assets/img/userguide/PDF-Viewing-3.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Provided the active user has permission, a printable copy of the PDF form and its data can be exported.

This power extends to simple form submissions as well. For example, if the traditional version of the form is filled out
through an email or some other service, users can still print the submission in PDF form.
