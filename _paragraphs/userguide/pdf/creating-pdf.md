At their heart, PDFs are just fancy forms. So in order to get started, simply select ```+ New Form``` from
within any project to get started. 

![](/assets/img/userguide/PDF-Create-1.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

A window will appear, prompting the user to select the type of form they wish to construct. Select ```PDF Form``` to 
continue.

Next, select ```upload PDF``` and the computers file management system will appear, allowing users to find and 
select any PDF on their machine. After selection, it may take a moment while the platform uploads and processes 
the submission. The Larger the file, the longer the processing time.

After completion, the PDF will display in the traditional platform builder with two notable differences. 
the first being the available PDF components ready to be placed on the PDF. The second being the display as option, 
but more on that later. For now, create a **name**, **title** and **API path** before saving the PDF Form.

Once saved, the PDF Form will now act like any other form on the platform.

This means users can integrate PDFs with staging, team workflows, and form versioning all while using a simple, drag and drop interface.
