With a PDF Form constructed, users can now begin interfacing with the document by adding a variety 
of components to the document. Simply clicking and drag any component to begin constructing dynamic PDFs.

Whenever a component is placed, the traditional dialog menu will appear allowing for labeling and 
defining the component particulars. When finished, click ```Save```.

Once saved, the component will persist on the PDF document. At this point, users can click and drag the 
component to reposition it or click once to reopen the dialog box shown above.

With a completed form (shown below) it is worth mentioning that the PDF and components added above are regular
form elements and can just as easily be converted back into a traditional form.

Calling attention to the ```display as``` select menu, switching from **PDF** to **Form** will reveal the standard 
platform interface for forms.

The ability to toggle between a **Form** and **PDF** interface so readily illustrates the power of the platform. 
When building applications, the JSON schema can be updated according by changing  **display: "pdf"** to  **display: "form"**
and visa versa, users can replicate the platforms functionality, allowing for both interfaces to connect to the same API endpoints seamlessly.
