In addition to creating and uploading existing PDF documents, the Form.io platform can be used to create PDF's of normal webform submissions. To achieve this, first create a new webform by clicking on the **Forms** section and then click on **Create Form** and then **API Webform**

![](/assets/img/userguide/pdf/create-webform.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail } 

Once you are here, create a new Webform with several sections using the **Panel** component, like this.

![](/assets/img/userguide/pdf/webform.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail } 

Once, the form is created, you can now create a new submission by clicking on **Use** button and then fill out the form you just created.

![](/assets/img/userguide/pdf/form-fill.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Once you fill out the form and create a new submission, you will be redirected to a submission view page, where you will then see a **PDF** icon to download the submission. 

![](/assets/img/userguide/pdf/downloadpdf.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Clicking this icon will then create a submission as a PDF for download or print.
