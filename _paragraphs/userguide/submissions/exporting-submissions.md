Use the two buttons at the top of the submissions list to export all of your data for a form. These operations are streamed from the database which means they should start very quickly and will work on very large datasets without having to write everything out to the server before starting the download.

#### Export JSON

JSON is Javascript Object Notation and is a way of representing data in a common way for javascript applications. Many other programming languages are able to read in JSON as well. Since data in Form.io is stored in JSON format, this will be the truest form of the data.

#### Export CSV

CSV is Comma Separated Values and data is squashed down to rows of values with commas between them. This may not work well for complex data structures as it is essentially a flat file. CSV files can be opened by spreadsheet applications like Excel.
