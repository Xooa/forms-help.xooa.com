To edit a stage, including renaming or deleting a stage, click the settings button or the gear icon 
in the left navigation panel of the active project. 

![](/assets/img/userguide/userguide-stage-edit-1.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

From the ```Stage Settings``` accordion panel users can rename, delete, or even protect a stage from modification.

Protected mode prevents the modification of any form or resource within that particular stage.
Protected stages have a shield icon anchored to the left of the stage name making them easy to identify outside
of the stage settings panel. Please note, the **Live** stage cannot be deleted or renamed.
