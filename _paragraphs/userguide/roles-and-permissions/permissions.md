There are eight (8) Permissions for each core entity within the Form.io platform. The core entities are Projects, Forms, and Submissions. The following eight permissions available for each, and are assignable on a per Role basis; Additionally, all Roles and Permissions and are self contained within each Project:

 - **Create All**
 - **Read All**
 - **Update All**
 - **Delete All**
 - **Create Own**
 - **Read Own**
 - **Update Own**
 - **Delete Own**

These Permissions grant users certain functions and behaviors that can be applied to a role within a Project and corresponding Application. As a general rule of thumb, the _all permissions are usually granted to Administrative roles, where as the _own permissions are usually configured for end users to secure each users data.

Facts to consider with the following definitions:

 - The owner of a project has full control to do any action within their Project.
 - Forms are configured to allow all roles to access their definitions by default.
 - Submission access is disabled for every form by default. E.g. to enable anonymous submissions, you need to configure the Anonymous role to have create_own or create_all access in your specific form.
 - The update_all permissions for submissions, also grants the create_all permission for submissions within the same form.
 - The read_all Project permission is currently used for determining index access for Forms and Roles.
 - Only the Project owner can delete a Project.

Each of these basic Permissions are defined below:

#### Configuring Roles and Permissions

Once Roles have been created, there are a few different ways to configure and manage Roles/Permissions within your Project.

1.  Select Edit next to any role on your role Settings page:

    ![4 edit role](/assets/img/userguide/userguide-roles-access-edit.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

    This will give you a list of all forms or resources that hold the selected Role, along with their Permissions, within the entire project. Simply hit edit next to the form you want to configure and apply your changes:

    ![5 edit permission](/assets/img/userguide/userguide-roles-access-edit-permission.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

    Now you can select the Roles you want to associate with each Permission. Remember to save any changes made:

    ![6 permission](/assets/img/userguide/userguide-roles-access-permission.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

2.  Assign permissions by clicking the **Permissions** button located at the top right of the page within a form or resource. Each permission may be assigned a role or more than one role, by clicking in the Roles field. Remember, you can always add, delete, and edit a role at anytime. (Changes are saved automatically)

<p class="note"> The Project owner will have all permissions to any Form and Resource submissions by default.</p>
