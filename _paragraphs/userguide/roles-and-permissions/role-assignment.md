Once Roles and Permissions have been configured, you can implement your configurations to a Resource or Form by adding an Authentication Action or a Role Assignment Action. To add an Action, click the **Action** tab on the top right of the page within a Form or Resource. Click the **Select an Action** button for a list of available Actions.

More information about the [Authentication Action](#action-authentication) and [Role Assignment Action](#action-role-assignment) can be found in the [Actions Section](#actions).
