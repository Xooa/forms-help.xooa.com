The form.io Server Enterprise Edition requires a license to run. To obtain a license, purchase a team pro or enterprise project and contact our support. They will send you a license that can be used with your server.

Once you have the license, set it in an environment variable called LICENSE for either Node.js or Docker, depending on your run method.

The enterprise server will not start without a license.
