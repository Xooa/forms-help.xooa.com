On-Premise Environments are supported with two different technologies, Docker and Node.js. We recommend using Docker over Node.js as it provides a pre-built and fully tested runtime. When using Node.js it is up to your organization to ensure all the dependencies are installed and up to date.

Docker is available via a public docker respository at [https://hub.docker.com/r/formio/formio-enterprise](https://hub.docker.com/r/formio/formio-enterprise) and can be used with a license.

Please contact support for information on how to deploy with an npm package.
