The Node version of the form.io Server Enterprise Edition is run in a Node.js context. This can be any Node.js 8.x or above.

#### Accessing the GitHub image
Once on a team pro or enterprise plan, you will need to have access to the private repository. Our private repositories are located on GitHub.

[https://github.com/formio/formio-enterprise](https://github.com/formio/formio-enterprise)

Since the image is a private GitHub respository, you will need to log in with your GitHub account and test cloning the repository. If you are unable to clone the repository, please contact support with your username and account information.

Follow the directions in the Readme of the formio-enterpise repository to finish the setup.
