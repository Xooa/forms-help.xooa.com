When a developer logs in to the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** platform, they arrive on their own individual **User Portal Page**. This page is the main page and has a growing amount of general content for the developer. Here you can create a new project, manage existing projects, as well as manage your TEAMs.
