Whenever you see the word **Application** used within this User Guide, it is referring to the Application that developers are building outside of **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;**.

**&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** major components are created within the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** system, and are ultimately used in customer Application implementations. It is important to distinguish a customer Application from the work being completing within **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;**.

When developers are working within **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** to create major components for their customer Applications, we refer to that work as **Projects**.
