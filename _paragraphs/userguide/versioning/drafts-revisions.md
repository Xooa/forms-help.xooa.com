**Form Versioning** also supports a draft feature where changes can be made without publishing a new version. Continuing
with the example, **(D) Version Field** has been added and saved as a draft.  

![](/assets/img/userguide/versioning-draft-1.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

An inspection of the revisions tab will reveal that a draft now exists.

![](/assets/img/userguide/versioning-draft-2.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

Drafting is primary used to test form construction without overwriting the active form revision. As a result once 
a draft is published, it will disappear from the revisions page. Lastly, there can only ever be one active draft at a time.
