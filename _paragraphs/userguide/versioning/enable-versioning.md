To get started, create or enter an existing project. For the purpose of this walk-through, an HTML element will
be anchored to the top of each form to keep track of the current iteration.

To enable Form Versioning, expand the ```Advanced Settings``` tab by clicking on it.

Form Revisions can be configured in two different ways:

  - Enabled – Use current form version when viewing submission
    - Will display all form submission data in the most recent form revision.
  - Enabled – Use original form version when viewing submission 
    - Will display form submission data in the form revision that it was captured in. 

This functionality extends to wherever users choose to view their submission data. This includes viewing their data
from within the **&lt;<span class="text-primary">form</span>.<span class="text-secondary">io</span>&gt;** platform or 
externally like inside the users application.

Afterwards, click either ```Create Form``` if creating the a new form or ```Publish``` when interacting with an
existing form. Once saved, **Form Versioning** is now enabled and the ```Revisions``` tab is now available for user interaction.

Once inside the revisions interface, users can see the full scope of their current development cycle. Important information 
such as who made the revision, when the revision was made, the revision number, and any notes made are all available. 
Additionally, several actions are now available.

   - Use 
     - Will enter the traditional form ```Use``` tab in that form revision. 
   - Data 
     - Will display form submission data that was captured in that form revision. 
   - Restore 
     - Will make a clone of the current revision, iterating the Vid to the most recent revision. 

These items will be covered in depth further down.
