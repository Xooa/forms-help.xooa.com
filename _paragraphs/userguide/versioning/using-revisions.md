By default, the ```Use``` tab will display the most recent form revision (the one with the highest Vid).

However, users can interact with the ```Use``` action from within the ```Revisions``` tab to use specific 
form revisions.

![](/assets/img/userguide/versioning-using-2.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

When using Vid #1, the original form is displayed, notice how **(C) Version Field** is no longer present. 

![](/assets/img/userguide/versioning-using-3.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

When using Vid #2, notice **(C) Version Field** is present again as well as the change to the tracking field.
