A 3rd revision has been added where **(B) Version Field** has been removed. 
Additionally, the following submissions have been made to each for form version:

  - Version 1: 2 submissions made
    - (A) { Apple1, Apple2 }
    - (B) { Banana1, Banana2 }
  - Version 2: 3 submissions made 
    - (A) { Apricot1, Apricot2, Apricot3 }
    - (B) { Blueberry1, Blueberry2, Blueberry3 } 
    - (C) { Cherry1, Cherry2, Cherry3 }
  - Version 3: 2 submissions made
    - (A) { Avocado1, Avocado2 }
    - (C) { Carrot1, Carrot2 } 

A simple inspection of the ```Data``` action for Vid #1 will reveal the two submissions listed in the table above.

Notice that only submissions made using Vid #1 are displayed. Ergo Apricot and Avocado entries are not present.

To view all submissions, click the ```Data``` tab at top and all 7 entries will display.  
Notice, that **(B) Version Field** entries are not displayed.

Not to worry, as illustrated above, the data is still there. 
Recall that the most recent form revision removed **(B) Version Field** and as a result the data table only
displays key value pairs that exist within the active form.
