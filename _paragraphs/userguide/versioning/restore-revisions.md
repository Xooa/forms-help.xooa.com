Since **(B) Version Field** data is hidden due to the current form revision not having that field, the restore action can be evoked to
recover the former layout. From the ```Revision``` tab, selecting ```Restore``` will being the restoration process.

and other components added. Notice, that **(B) Version Field** has been restored and a note has been made.

Upon publishing the form, a return visit to the ```Revisions``` tab will reveal a new revision, Vid 4.
Additionally, the note made during the restoration process is also visible.

It is important to note that restoring a form does not overwrite or alter the original revision. Instead, a new 
revision is made which is why there are now 4 revisions. Continuing, a visit to ```Data```
tab will reveal that **(B) Version Field** and its respective data, has returned.
