Images within Form.io are created on the Form using the **File** component, which is capable of uploading images.

Displaying the images, however, is done within the implementation of the application retrieving the data. As an example, here
is an Angular directive which illustrates how an image can be loaded within a ```<img>``` tag within your application dynamically
from the **file** component on the form.
