This walk-through seeks to replace the local variables used in the above example with remote data stored in a platform resource.
Please take this opportunity to download and import the <a href="/assets/project/language.json">resource.json</a> that
we'll be using for the next part of the walk-through. Once finished, feel free to make a few language submission, for reference here is
the spanish submission used in the demo.

As a point of reference, the language text-field defines the language codes while the data grid is responsible
for creating the key value pairs which will manages the actual translated content. Finally, you will want to markdown the
submission Id which can be found URL when viewing the submission data.
