This guide builds off many concepts reviewed in the [Form.io Translations](/tutorials/walkthroughs/translations/) walk-through.
The translation option used during form construction are the identical with the exception of where the data in stored.
Instead of manually defining the translation definitions in the application layer, translations are stored in a remote
resource within the users project on [portal.form.io](http://portal.form.io/#/). As a result, users can either embed a form
within the project itself to modify the remote resource or use [portal.form.io](http://portal.form.io/#/) as
an interface to manage form translations directly.
