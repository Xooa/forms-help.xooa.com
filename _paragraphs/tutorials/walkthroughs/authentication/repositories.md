Before diving into the authentication walk through, here is a list of several resource, including application modules
that we will be importing throughout this walk-through. Additionally, you will be expected to have:

 - A Form.io Account - visit [portal.form.io](https://portal.form.io) to register
 - A email service - this demo will use [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/) but you are welcome your own service.
