While many topics such as: user login, roles and permission, email configuration, and  application layer logic can be found
throughout our docs, particularly within our [integrations section](/integrations/start), this guide combines these concepts
an Angular 2+ application that integrates many of these aforementioned concepts. That said, many of the concepts will focus
using the [Form.io Portal](https://portal.form.io/#/auth) and much of the application code can be easily ported into other
frameworks.
