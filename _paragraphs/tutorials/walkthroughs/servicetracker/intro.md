The **Service Tracker** is an application that allows for equipment dealers to manage their customers as well as their service technicians that they need to maintain that equipment.

For example, lets say you are building a Serverless web application for a company that sells HVAC equipment through a number of *Dealers*. Each *Dealer* has their own *Customers* that they need to manage within the application. In addition, each *Customer* should be assigned *Equipment* which the *Dealer* has sold to them. To complicate it further, each *Dealer* would like to have their own *Contractors* who are used to service that *Equipment*. They would like to be able to schedule *Appointments* and issue *Time Clocks* for each *Appointment*. Normally, an application like this would present enough complexities that it would be hard to cover in a single walkthrough, but with Form.io, these kind of applications are made trivial.

Here is a video where I show off the Form.io structure of this application we will be building from scratch in this tutorial.
