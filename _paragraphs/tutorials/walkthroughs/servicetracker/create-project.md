After you have your computer setup with all the dependencies, the first thing you will want to do is create your project within Form.io. You may notice that there is already a **Service Tracker** template within Form.io, so we will just use that as our starting point and then walk through the resources & forms within this tutorial to help understand how the project is structured.

Once you create your project, you will presented with the project page overview. If you are new to Form.io, then I highly recommend reading through the [User Guide](/userguide/introduction/) to understand all of the components about our Project interface. For this tutorial, we will simply be focusing on the Resource & Forms that create the structure.
