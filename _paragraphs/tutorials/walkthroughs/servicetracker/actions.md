Once you create the resources, it is typical to shift our focus over to the Actions performed and Roles assigned for each of those resources. It is recommended to [read up on our Actions](/userguide/actions/) as well as [the Roles and Permissions](/userguide/roles-and-permissions/) section before getting into this part so that you fully understand what they are and how they are utilized. To keep this walkthrough tutorial primarily focused on the application development process, I would highly recommend watching the video at the beginning of this tutorial since it goes into great detail how the Roles and Permissions as well as Actions are configured for this application.
