Formio.js uses i18n, a lightweight translation module, which allow users to pass in a translation option during form construction. This gives users direct control over several form settings such as: 

 - Setting a form's default language
 - Changing a form's default error messages
 - Defining a form's default language behaviour 
 - Translating a form's custom message object that was defined in the JSON definition

The guide that follows illustrates how to leverage this module in any application, regardless of framework preference.
