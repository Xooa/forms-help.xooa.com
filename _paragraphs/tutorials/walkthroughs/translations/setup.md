Since the translations of Form.io elements are handled by our core library, the implementation can be executed via pure javascript.
Below is as an example of a bare-bones use case of our [core renderer](https://github.com/formio/formio.js) that we'll be adding
code to throughout this walk through.  

<div id="step1">
  <script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/Formio/83tkkzLc/embed/result,js,html,css/"></script>
</div>
