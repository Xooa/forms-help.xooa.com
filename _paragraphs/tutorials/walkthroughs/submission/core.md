Since there is a great deal going on in this application, we will start by taking notice of the parent form's text-field.
It appears to have a default value of ```Populating...``` when in actuality, its value is generated by the application and
is independent of the form's definition.

<div id="formiojs">
  <script async src="https://jsfiddle.net/Formio/obhgrrd8/embed/result,js,html,css/"></script>
</div>

Taking a look at the javascript, note the event listener that checks our parent form's select component value
every time a form change is made. If a new value is selected or changed, the nested form's text-field will
dynamically update. For your convince, a ```Log Submission``` button has been added to the form. Engaging with the button
will print to the console the current the submission object. For example, selecting any ```Populate Option x```
and then logging the submission will show that the nested form's populated value is now attached to the submission object.
Finally, the other buttons illustrate other common use cases for injecting data. The first button demonstrates a manual
approach to populating a nested form, while the final two fetch and inject data from the Form.io servers.
