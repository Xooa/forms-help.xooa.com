Once you create a new Azure account, the first thing you will want to do is to create a **Resource Group** that will contain all of the deployments from this walkthrough. You can do this by click on the **Resource Groups** menu item on the left side of the screen, and then click **+ Add** button.

Now that you have a resource group, you can now add all your other resources within this group, starting with a **Cosmos** database.
