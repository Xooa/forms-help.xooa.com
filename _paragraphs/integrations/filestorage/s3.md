The S3 Storage provider allows file storage and retrieval using any S3 compatible service but was specifically designed for Amazon Web Services S3.

*For an on premise compatible solution, try minio. See our [minio installation guide](/integrations/filestorage/#minio).*

If you haven't already done so, go to [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up for an account.

In order to use S3, you will need to configure an IAM user and an S3 bucket.

#### Create an IAM user

 - Go to **Services &#10072; IAM** and click on the *Users* tab.

 - Click the <span class="btn btn-primary">Add User</span> button.

 - Enter a user name such as "S3" and then click **Programatic Access**, then click **Next** button.
   
   ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/s3/iam-new-user.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }

 - Skip the page where you add the user to a group.
 - On the last page, press **Create User**
 - On the next page, it should show you your access keys. You will need to copy those and add them to a note on your computer which you will need later.
   
   ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/s3/add-user-keys.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }
 
 - Now press **Close** button, which will take you back to the users list.
 - Find the user we just created and then click on their name, which will show you their Summary
 - Copy the ARN of that user and save it along with your Access Keys from earlier.

 - We are now ready to create the **S3** bucket.

#### Create an S3 bucket

 - Go to **Services &#10072; S3**
 - Click <span class="btn btn-primary">+ Create Bucket</span> and enter a name and region for the bucket and click **Next**
 
   ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/s3/create-bucket.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }
 
 - Click **Next** for all the other pages of the wizard to complete the creation of the bucket. We can configure all of these options after the bucket is created.
 - Next click on that bucket which will take you to the bucket page. Click on the **Permissions** tab.
 
   ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/s3/permissions-tab.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }
 
 - Now, click on **Bucket Policy** button and then add the following policy to your bucket.

   ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "UploadFile",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXX:user/S3"
          },
          "Action": [
            "s3:GetObject",
            "s3:PutObjectAcl",
            "s3:PutObject"
          ],
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/*"
        }
      ]
    }
   ```
 - If you wish to have **Public Read** access to your files, then you will need to add the following rule to your policy.
 
   ```json
    {
       "Sid": "crossdomainAccess",
       "Effect": "Allow",
       "Principal": "*",
       "Action": "s3:GetObject",
       "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/crossdomain.xml"
    }
   ```
   
   So that it looks like the following.
   
   ```json
    {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
          {
             "Sid": "UploadFile",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": {
                "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXX:user/S3"
             },
             "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl",
                "s3:PutObject"
             ],
             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/*"
          },
          {
             "Sid": "crossdomainAccess",
             "Effect": "Allow",
             "Principal": "*",
             "Action": "s3:GetObject",
             "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::formio-upload/crossdomain.xml"
          }
       ]
    }
   ```

 - **Important Note** You will need to make sure you replace the ```arn:aws:iam::XXXXXX:user/S3``` with the ARN you copied when you created the user, and also replace the ```formio-upload``` with the name of your new bucket.
 - Next click on **CORS configuration** and add the following.
 
   ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
       <CORSRule>
           <AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>
           <AllowedMethod>POST</AllowedMethod>
           <AllowedMethod>PUT</AllowedMethod>
           <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
           <AllowedMethod>HEAD</AllowedMethod>
           <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
           <AllowedHeader>*</AllowedHeader>
       </CORSRule>
    </CORSConfiguration>
   ```
   
 - You may replace ```<AllowedOrigin>*</AllowedOrigin>``` with the domain names of the sites your app will be running on or leave it open.
 - Make sure you save the configuration and the bucket settings.

#### S3 Bucket Encryption (optional)
Form.io also supports S3 Encryption to provide further safety with the files that are stored within the S3 system. If you wish to enable this feature, you can do so by click on the **Properties** tab, then click on **Default Encryption** and then provide the encryption you would like to use.

Your S3 bucket should now be properly configured.

#### Enter S3 Project Settings

 - On form.io go to your Project Settings page and Click on **Integrations &#10072; File Storage &#10072; S3 Storage**
 - Enter the information for the IAM user and S3 bucket you just created. Make sure to provide all the necessary configurations that match the setup that you configured. For example, like this.
   ![](/assets/img/integrations/aws/s3/s3-settings.png){: .img-fluid .img-thumbnail }
 - The following credentials can be provided.

   {: .table .table-bordered .table-striped}
