The Dropbox storage provider allows using the [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com){:target="_blank"}  service for storing files within your project.

To connect your project to Dropbox, go to Project Settings->File Storage->Dropbox. Click the Connect to Dropbox button. A window will open asking you to authorize Form.io to access your Dropbox account. After allowing it you should see "Your project is connected to a Dropbox account." This indicates that your project has successfully connected.

Next add a File component to a form and select "Dropbox" as the storage provider. Save the form.

All files added to that file component should now be immediately added to the Dropbox folder. Files are limited to 150MB.
