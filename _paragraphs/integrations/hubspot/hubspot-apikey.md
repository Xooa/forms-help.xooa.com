In order to use the Hubspot integration, you will need an API key from Hubspot. To get your API key, you can read their documentation at [http://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key](http://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/integrations/how-do-i-get-my-hubspot-api-key) or get it directly at [https://app.hubspot.com/keys/get](https://app.hubspot.com/keys/get).

Once you have the key, go to your project settings on form.io and enter the API Key in the Hubspot section.

If you add a Hubspot action to a form before setting your API Key, the options will not populate as the information cannot be pulled from Hubspot.
