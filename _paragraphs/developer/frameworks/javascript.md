The core front-end library for Form.io is the [JavaScript Form Renderer & SDK](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/wiki) library. This library allows you to embed forms within your application and communicate to the Form.io platform API's.

The core formio.js library serves as the basis for all other framework libraries. It provides a full form renderer that is built entirely in javascript. Each additional framework has a wrapper around it that enables full interaction of the form with the underlying framework.

You can also use this library in any other javascript framework or natively in an html website.
