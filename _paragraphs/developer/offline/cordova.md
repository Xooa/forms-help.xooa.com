The offline plugin also supports cordova applications developed for mobile platforms. In order for it to work you will need the ```cordova-plugin-indexeddb-async``` plugin.

We have a demo application for how to set up a cordova offline application. You can add a frontend framework to this as well but this app is javascript only within cordova.
